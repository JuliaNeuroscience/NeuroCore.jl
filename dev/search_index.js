This means that most properties in this package have a way of retrieving, setting, and enforcing type stability for each property (anything defined using the macro @defprop). For example, epoch_length(x)'s default behavior is to call getproperty(x, :epoch_length) and epoch_length!(x, val)'s default behavior is to call setproperty!(x, :epoch_length, val). Therefore, any given type can use this method by simply defining a field named epoch_length. Details on the order of calls, enforcing certain return types, and documenting properties is further defined in the FieldProperties.jl) documentation.","category":"page"},{"location":"introduction_properties/#Why-use-properties?-1","page":"Introduction to Properties","title":"Why use properties?","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"introduction_properties/#","page":"Introduction to Properties","title":"Introduction to Properties","text":"Instead of pursuing a single data structure that everyone else conforms to, NeuroCore allows for any data structure as long as the return type of a given method is consistent. This solution is much more tenable than enforcing a limited set of structures, which would require continually changes to structures in order to meet the needs of an evolving field. For example, there are many neurophysiology file formats. Numerous efforts to form a universal standard have yet to be fully adopted in the neuroscience community. Using NeuroCore allows users to have a consistent API right now and developers the flexibility of optimizing hardware and file formats over time.
