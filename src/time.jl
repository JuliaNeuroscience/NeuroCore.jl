The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the

(in JSON format) containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in
relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the
slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note
that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is
important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In
particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in
`SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis
(i.e., the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of
slice 0). This parameter is REQUIRED for sparse sequences that do not have the
`delay_time` field set. In addition without this parameter slice time correction
will not be possible.
