The coil combination method used for image acquisiton. Almost all fMRI studies
using phased-array coils use root-sum-of-squares (rSOS) combination, but other
methods exist. The image reconstruction is changed by the coil combination method
(as for the matrix coil mode above), so anything non-standard should be reported.

The gradient set type. It should be possible to infer the gradient coil from the
scanner model. If not, e.g. because of a custom upgrade or use of a gradient insert
set, then the specifications of the actual gradient coil should be reported independently.

The information describing the receiver coil. Corresponds to DICOM Tag

"""
Information describing the active/selected elements of the receiver coil. This
doesn’t correspond to a tag in the DICOM ontology. The vendor-defined terminology
for active coil elements can go in this field. As an example, for
Siemens, coil channels are typically not activated/selected individually, but
rather in pre-defined selectable "groups" of individual channels, and the list
of the "groups" of elements that are active/selected in any given scan
populates the Coil String entry in Siemens’ private DICOM fields (e.g., HEA;HEP
for the Siemens standard 32 ch coil when both the anterior and posterior groups
are activated). This is a flexible field that can be used as most appropriate
for a given vendor and coil to define the "active" coil elements. Since
individual scans can sometimes not have the intended coil elements selected, it
is preferable for this field to be populated directly from the DICOM for each
individual scan, so that it can be used as a mechanism for checking that a
given scan was collected with the intended coil elements selected.
