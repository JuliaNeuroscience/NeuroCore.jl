    onset(x) -> Float64

Onset (in seconds) of the event measured from the beginning of the acquisition
of the first volume in the corresponding task imaging data file. If any acquired
scans have been discarded before forming the imaging data file, ensure that a
time of 0 corresponds to the first image stored. In other words negative numbers
in "onset" are allowed.

Duration of the event (measured from onset) in seconds. Must always be either
zero or positive. A "duration" value of zero implies that the delta function or
event is so short as to be effectively modeled as an impulse.

Primary categorisation of each trial to identify them as instances of the

response inhibition experimental conditions.

the file formats of the stimuli files, but they should be stored in the
/stimuli folder (under the root folder of the dataset; with optional
subfolders). The values under the stim_file column correspond to a path
relative to "/stimuli". For example "images/cat03.jpg" will be translated
to "/stimuli/images/cat03.jpg".
