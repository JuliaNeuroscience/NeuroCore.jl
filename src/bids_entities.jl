Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `ineg, `jneg`, `kneg` (the axis of the NIfTI data along which
slices were acquired, and the direction in which SliceTiming is defined with
respect to). `i`, `j`, `k` identifiers correspond to the first, second and third axis
of the data in the NIfTI file. `*neg` indicates that the contents of
SliceTiming are defined in reverse order - that is, the first entry corresponds
to the slice with the largest index, and the final entry corresponds to slice
index zero. When present, the axis defined by SliceEncodingDirection needs to be
consistent with the ‘slicedim’ field in the NIfTI header. When absent, the
entries in SliceTiming must be in the order of increasing slice index as defined

The time at which each slice was acquired within each volume (frame) of the

(in JSON format) containing the time (in seconds) of each slice acquisition in
relation to the beginning of volume acquisition. The list goes through the
slices along the slice axis in the slice encoding dimension (see below). Note
that to ensure the proper interpretation of the `SliceTiming` field, it is
important to check if the OPTIONAL `SliceEncodingDirection` exists. In
particular, if `SliceEncodingDirection` is negative, the entries in
`SliceTiming` are defined in reverse order with respect to the slice axis
(i.e., the final entry in the `SliceTiming` list is the time of acquisition of
slice 0). This parameter is REQUIRED for sparse sequences that do not have the
`DelayTime` field set. In addition without this parameter slice time correction
will not be possible.
