Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-`. The letters `i`, `j`, `k`
correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIFTI file.
The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum
index unless `-` sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from
the highest index instead of zero). `PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the
direction along which phase is was modulated which may result in visible
distortions. Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term
`InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values. This
parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present or when using
multiple runs with different phase encoding directions (which can be later used
for field inhomogeneity correction).

    effective_echo_spacing(x) -> Float64

Returns the effective echo spacing.

The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds, between lines in the
phase-encoding direction, defined based on the size of the reconstructed image
in the phase direction. It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as
"dwell time" (see `DwellTime` parameter below for actual dwell time). It is
required for unwarping distortions using field maps. Note that beyond just
in-plane acceleration, a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding
need to be accounted for properly, including partial fourier, phase
oversampling, phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.<sup>2</sup>
This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present.

<sup>2</sup>Conveniently, for Siemensâ€™ data, this value is easily obtained as
1/[`BWPPPE` * `ReconMatrixPE`], where BWPPPE is the
"`BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode` in DICOM tag (0019,1028) and ReconMatrixPE is
the size of the actual reconstructed data in the phase direction (which is NOT
reflected in a single DICOM tag for all possible aforementioned scan
manipulations). See [here](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/kb-articles/kb-0003) and
