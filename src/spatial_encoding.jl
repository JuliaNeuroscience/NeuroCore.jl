Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-`. The letters `i`, `j`, `k`

The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum
index unless `-` sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from
the highest index instead of zero). `PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the
direction along which phase is was modulated which may result in visible
distortions. Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term
`InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values. This
parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present or when using
multiple runs with different phase encoding directions (which can be later used
for field inhomogeneity correction).

    effective_echo_spacing(x) -> F64Sec

Returns the effective echo spacing.

The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds, between lines in the
phase-encoding direction, defined based on the size of the reconstructed image
in the phase direction. It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as
"dwell time" (see `DwellTime` parameter below for actual dwell time). It is
required for unwarping distortions using field maps. Note that beyond just
in-plane acceleration, a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding
need to be accounted for properly, including partial fourier, phase
oversampling, phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.<sup>2</sup>
This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present.

<sup>2</sup>Conveniently, for Siemensâ€™ data, this value is easily obtained as
1/[`BWPPPE` * `ReconMatrixPE`], where BWPPPE is the
"`BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode` in DICOM tag (0019,1028) and ReconMatrixPE is
the size of the actual reconstructed data in the phase direction (which is NOT
reflected in a single DICOM tag for all possible aforementioned scan
manipulations). See [here](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/kb-articles/kb-0003) and

train. If `EffectiveEchoSpacing` has been properly computed, it is just
